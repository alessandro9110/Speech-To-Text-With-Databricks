    # ========================================================================
    # REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
    # ========================================================================
    # The following variables and secrets must be configured in the GitHub
    # repository settings under: Settings > Environments > Prod
    #
    # Required Variables:
    #   - DATABRICKS_HOST: The Databricks workspace URL
    #     Example: https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
    #   - ADMIN_USER_EMAIL: The email address of the admin user for production
    #     deployment permissions (used for CAN_MANAGE permission)
    #
    # Required Secrets:
    #   - DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID: The service principal application (client) ID
    #     This is the UUID of the service principal configured for OIDC
    #     authentication with GitHub Actions
    # ========================================================================
    env:
      DATABRICKS_AUTH_TYPE: github-oidc
      DATABRICKS_HOST: ${{ vars.DATABRICKS_HOST }}
      DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID }}

      # UPDATE GIT FOLDER IN WORKSPACE
      # ========================================================================
      # This step updates the git repository folder in the Databricks workspace
      # to sync the latest code from the main branch. This ensures the workspace
      # has the most recent version of the code before deploying the bundle.
      # ========================================================================
      - name: Update git folder
        # Set your workspace path and branch name here

      # ========================================================================
      # DEPLOY ASSET BUNDLE TO PRODUCTION
      # ========================================================================
      # Deploys the Databricks Asset Bundle to the prod target.
      # --auto-approve: skips interactive confirmation prompts (required for CI).
      # --target prod:  selects the production target defined in databricks.yml.
      # --var service_principal_id: passes the service principal application ID
      #   so that the prod target's run_as block can execute jobs/pipelines as
      #   the SP rather than as the deploying user.
      #
      # NOTE: ADMIN_USER_EMAIL is available as an env var above and can be
      #   activated by uncommenting the permissions block in databricks.yml
      #   (prod target) and adding --var="admin_user_email=${{ vars.ADMIN_USER_EMAIL }}"
      #   to the command below. This grants a human admin CAN_MANAGE on all
      #   prod bundle resources alongside the service principal.
